## Summary

-   This week’s lecture looked at how corrections are a key part of using remote sensing data and how very rarely we will ever work with raw/uncorrected images. We discussed concepts like how the angle at which passive images are captured can lead to variations in visible images, such as the presence of shadows or variations in absolute values due to atmospheric conditions if not adjusted for. I found the discussion around using water as a reference to normalise images interesting as water in effect was used as a basis to normalise everything else as it absorbs a lot of spectrum and can be treated as a zero value. Also, the discussion around shadow detection was another interesting one as depending on when image passover occur and the angles of the satellites the same locations can end up with different values due to shadows for example, due to seasonal variation and associated sun angles. Another common form of correction was in relation to cloud cover. We spoke about how some of the cloud masks offered by services like Google Earth Engine seem like a good idea in principle but in practice can have unintended consequences, such as removing land features which are mistakenly interpreted as clouds. The suggested way to do this is to filter based on cloud percentage rather than use cloud masks if that is possible. Alternatively, SAR data can be used to bypass clouds altogether, but may not be suitable if you’re interested in a specific band like SWIR etc… for your analysis.
-   Also, Andy also mentioned how some dimension reduction techniques like PCA can be used in an interesting manner to be able to show changes in land cover by incorporating the dates elements within the PCA process. I was initially a bit nervous about this topic as it seemed a bit esoteric, however, as I will likely be using remote sensing imagery as part of my dissertation it made sense to understand what adjustments had been made to the data I would be using to make comparisons across different time periods, geographies and instruments comparable to each other, which if not done could lead to erroneous conclusions.

## Application

This week, I’ve looked at how multiple different satellite instruments can be used to improve the spatial granularity of changes in methane done using a trio of Sentinel 5P, Sentinel 3 and Sentinel 2 (Pandey et al., 2023). Their analysis uses a multi-band multi-pass (MBMP) method which basically preprocesses out some noisy features like clouds in pixels that have no methane detected as well as doing some orientation analysis and using a model to generate valid methane values. They also make use of aggregations and filtering operations in this preprocessing stag as well as another dataset to understand wind speeds, as this is a crucial variable allowing for better detection methane plumes. Their approach to using the three satellites can be illustrated by the following image:

By identifying methane abnormalities with Sentinel-5P they are then able to look for similar pass overs in the sentinel 2 & 3 satellites and by looking at the SWIR bands narrow down the likely locations where the emission leaks originated from.

Nonetheless there are limits to how precise their approach can be as for example if there are multiple leaks in close proximity of each other these cannot be identified due to pixel resolution limitations.

They make a good case for what each of the satellites offer: 1. Sentinel-5P - identifies methane emission anomalies and serves as the starting point for further analysis 2. Sentinel 3 - with its daily coverage can be used to identify when emissions started and for how long they persist as well as narrow down the likely locations 3. Sentinel 2 - with the highest spatial granularity it is able to further narrow down likely emission originating locations

They also make an interesting observation regarding how differences in spectrum wavelength band ranges and spatial resolution interplay with each other by doing an analysis of emission plumes identified by Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 respectively. The main takeaway is that although Sentinel 3 has a narrower spectral wavelength band for its SWIR bands, in principle making it better for measuring methane emissions), Sentinel 2 has a higher spatial resolution and even with a wider SWIR band range is able to identify more methane emission plumes as there is less noise per pixel compared to Sentinel 3.

## Reflection

The MBMP approach here shows how, through using remote sensing data from multiple freely available satellites, it is possible to identify methane anomalies at a high level and using more granular and more frequent data, narrow down possible location candidates down to the days or even times of day (Pandey et al., 2023). Having previously tried to acquire satellite data from major providers, the default for achieving such an outcome would be to use a tasking satellite, which would be extremely costly if applied globally and/or for a prolonged period of time.

The research raises an interesting point about the trade-offs involved with the instruments, pass over times and spatial resolution available from the current generation of satellites. As I would typically have looked for a single solution that had the capability to answer the question I was facing (as suggested by Anton Chigurh a fictional character from No Country for Old Men, show below).

However, the paper makes a case for making the best use of what is available and instead of looking for a swiss-army knife, perhaps it would be best to instead use a crockery set.

All of this notwithstanding, there is an underlying concern I have with time period a tiered multi-device and multi-satellite mission approach like MBMP can be valid for. Relying on multiple missions exposes your risk to all of them, or put another way, when one mission ends, so does your ability to continue your approach. Despite the benefit of the built-in redundancy of having multiple satellites covering the same locations, there is a counter-intuitive risk associated with this as well. Unless the global community can provide comparable satellites running on overlapping mission time-frames with guarantees in place that historic datasets like Sentinel 3 will be able to continue being provided in some shape or form, it will remain a challenge for policymakers and policy evaluators to make remote sensing a primary component of their policy evaluation toolkit.
